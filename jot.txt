I want you to help me out with something I have a component 
called patient-dashbaord.tsx, It's prototyped such that patient 
some patient data in enbereded into into, Now what I want is instead
 of having the patients data enbereded into it, I want the patient data
  to be stored in a json fle and kept in the public dir, then use an endpoint 
  like that of anapi to call the patients data from the patient json file
   located in the public dir into the dashboard, are you ready?
